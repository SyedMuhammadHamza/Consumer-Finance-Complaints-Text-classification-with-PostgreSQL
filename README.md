# Consumer-Finance-Complaints-Text-classification-with-PostgreSQL

Recently I came across ![The Consumer Complaint Database](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database) Published by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, which is a U.S. government agency, “ The Database is a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that they sent to companies for response. Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first. Complaints referred to other regulators, such as complaints about depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, are not published in the Consumer Complaint Database ”.
